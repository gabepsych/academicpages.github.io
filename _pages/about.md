My name is Gabriel A. León ("Gabe") and I am a first-generation Latino college graduate and a proud native of Southern New Mexico.

As an aspiring clinical psychology, I aim to conduct research that informs the development of personalized, family-focused behavioral health interventions that meet the needs of marginalized communities impacted by chronic stress and trauma.

Research Positions
=====
I am currently a second year PhD student in Psychology at University of Southern California (USC) and a graduate research assistant working in the [Neuroendocrinology of Social Ties (NEST) Laboratory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nestlab/research/) under the mentorship of Dr. Darby E. Saxbe.

From 2019-2021, I worked as a graduate research assistant in the [Couples Coping with Stress Laboratory](https://ashleykrandall.wixsite.com/asucouplescoping), led by Dr. Ashley K. Randall.

Research Interests
=====
Broadly, I study interpersonal dynamics within families and close relationships - with a specific focus on stress. Namely, I am interested in 1) how close relationships within the family system serve to regulate stress and scaffold child development, and 2) how relationships themselves may deteriorate because of chronic stress exposure and trauma. 

My research leverages biological, physiological, and behavioral data collected across multiple timescales.

Current Projects
=====
* My recent work in the NEST Lab focuses on the deleterious effects of chronic stress on the interpersonal emotion dynamics of caregivers and infants during early childhood. 

* In another project, I am collecting data via ambulatory assessment (i.e., EMA, sleep actigraphy) from a diverse sample of families to study the impact of early life adversity and trauma across the transition to parenthood on stress coping during daily life.
