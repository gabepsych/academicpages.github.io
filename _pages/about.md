My name is Gabriel A. Le√≥n ("Gabe") and I am a first-generation Latino college graduate and a proud native of Southern New Mexico.

I am currently a second year PhD student in Psychology at University of Southern California (USC) and a graduate research assistant working in the [Neuroendocrinology of Social Ties (NEST) Laboratory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nestlab/research/) under the mentorship of Dr. Darby E. Saxbe.

As an aspiring clinical psychology, I aim to conduct research that informs the development of personalized, family-focused behavioral health interventions that meet the needs of marginalized communities impacted by chronic stress and trauma.

Research Interests
=====
Broadly, I study interpersonal dynamics within families and close relationships - with a specific focus on stress. Namely, I am interested in 1) how close relationships within the family system serve to regulate stress and scaffold child development, and 2) how relationships themselves may deteriorate because of chronic stress exposure and trauma. 

My research leverages biological, physiological, and behavioral data collected across multiple timescales.

Current Projects
=====
* My most recent work focuses on the deleterious effects of chronic stress on the interpersonal emotion dynamics of caregivers and infants during early childhood.

* In another project, I am collecting data via ambulatory assessment (i.e., EMA, sleep actigraphy) from a diverse sample of families to study the impact of early life adversity and peripartum trauma on stress coping during daily life.
