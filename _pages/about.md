My name is Gabriel A. Le√≥n ("Gabe") and I am a second year PhD student at University of Southern California (USC), first-generation Latino college graduate, and a native of Southern New Mexico. As an aspiring clinical scientist, I aim to conduct research that informs the development of personalized, family-focused behavioral health interventions that meet the needs of marginalized communities impacted by chronic stress and trauma.

I am currently a graduate research assistant working in the [Neuroendocrinology of Social Ties (NEST) Laboratory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nestlab/research/) under the mentorship of Dr. Darby E. Saxbe.

Formerly, I worked as a graduate research assistant in the [Couples Coping with Stress Laboratory]( https://ashleykrandall.wixsite.com/asucouplescoping) led by Dr. Ashley K. Randall.

Research Interests
=====
Broadly, I study interpersonal dynamics within families and close relationships - with a specific focus on stress. Namely, I am interested in 1) how close relationships within the family system serve to regulate stress and scaffold child development, and 2) how relationships themselves may deteriorate because of chronic stress exposure and trauma. 

My research leverages biological, physiological, and behavioral data collected across multiple timescales. By analyzing multimodal data streams, I seek to create personalized typologies of family stress which can inform behavioral health interventions for diverse families. 

Current Projects
=====
My recent work in the NEST Lab focuses on the deleterious effects of chronic stress on the interpersonal emotion dynamics of caregivers and infants during free play. 

In another project, I have designed an ambulatory assessment protocol (i.e., EMA, sleep actigraphy) to study stress coping during daily life in a racially- and socioeconomically-diverse sample of families. Capitalizing on advances in intensive longitudinal analysis, I will test if families ability to cope with daily stressors is impaired by exposure to early life adversity and trauma across the transition to parenthood.
