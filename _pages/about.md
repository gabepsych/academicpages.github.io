My name is Gabriel A. Le√≥n ("Gabe") and I am a first-generation Latino college graduate and a proud native of Southern New Mexico.

I am currently a second year PhD student in Psychology at University of Southern California (USC) and a graduate research assistant working in the [Neuroendocrinology of Social Ties (NEST) Laboratory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nestlab/research/) under the mentorship of Dr. Darby E. Saxbe.

As an aspiring clinical psychologist, I aim to conduct research that informs personalized, family-focused behavioral health interventions that meet the needs of marginalized communities impacted by chronic stress and trauma.

Research Interests
=====
Broadly, I study interpersonal dynamics within families and close relationships - with a specific focus on stress. Namely, I am interested in 1) how close relationships within the family system serve to regulate stress and scaffold child development, and 2) how relationships themselves may deteriorate because of chronic stress exposure and trauma. 

My research leverages biological, physiological, and behavioral data collected across multiple timescales.

Current Projects
=====
* My most recent work focuses on the deleterious effects of chronic stress on the interpersonal emotion dynamics of caregivers and infants during early childhood.

* In another project, I am collecting data via ambulatory assessment (i.e., EMA, sleep actigraphy) from a diverse sample of families to study the impact of early life adversity and peripartum trauma on stress coping during daily life.

Clinical Work
=====
Prior to attending USC, I completed over 240 direct service hours while working at an adolescent outpatient clinic in Phoenix, AZ. I provided individual therapy for clients ages 13-25 and co-led three intensive outpatient groups for substance use disorder, social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, and self-injurious behavior. 

At USC, I provide therapy and neuropsychological services through the USC Psychological Services Center (PSC), where I am supervised and trained in culturally-responsive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and acceptance and committment therapy (ACT). 

In collaboration with colleagues at USC, I have helped to design and implement a process-based parenting class for Homeboy Industries, the largest gang rehabilitation center in the world. We visit Homeboy Industries each week to offer this class to members of the Los Angeles community who have recently exited from prison.
