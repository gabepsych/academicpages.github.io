My name is Gabriel A. Le√≥n ("Gabe") and I am a first-generation Latino college graduate and a proud native of Southern New Mexico.

I am currently a second year PhD student in Psychology at University of Southern California (USC) and a graduate research assistant working in the [Neuroendocrinology of Social Ties (NEST) Laboratory](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nestlab/research/) under the mentorship of Dr. Darby E. Saxbe.

As an aspiring clinical psychologist, I aim to conduct research that informs personalized, family-focused behavioral health interventions that meet the needs of marginalized communities impacted by chronic stress and trauma.

Research Interests
=====
Broadly, I study interpersonal dynamics within families and close relationships - with a specific focus on stress. Namely, I am interested in the biopsychosocial processes by which stress propogates and remits within the family system. I aim to leverage multimodal, biobehavioral data streams to understand targets of interventions that support resilience in parents and children coping with traumatic and chronic stress.

Current Projects
=====
* My most recent work focuses on the effects of chronic stress on interpersonal emotion dynamics between parents and infants at six-months postpartum.

* In another project, I am working on identifying the biopsychosocial correlates of hair cortisol concentration - a non-invasive measure of HPA axis output and a possible marker of chronic stress. To answer this question, I am applying contemporary machine-learning techniques (e.g., random forest regression) to a high-dimensional cross-sectional sample of mothers and infants from across the United States. 

* Finally, I am collecting data via ambulatory assessment (i.e., EMA, sleep actigraphy) from a diverse sample of families from the Los Angeles area to study the impact of early life adversity and peripartum trauma on stress coping during daily life.

Clinical Work
=====
Prior to attending USC, I worked for an [adolescent outpatient clinic](https://www.embarkbh.com/locations/outpatient-therapy-phoenix-arizona/) in Phoenix, AZ. I provided individual therapy for clients ages 13-25 and co-led three intensive outpatient groups for substance use disorder, social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, and self-injurious behavior. 

At USC, I provide therapy and neuropsychological services through the [USC Psychological Services Center (PSC)](https://dornsife.usc.edu/usc-psc), where I am supervised and trained in culturally-responsive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and acceptance and committment therapy (ACT). 

Every Wednesday, I visit [Homeboy Industries](https://homeboyindustries.org/), the largest gang rehabilitation center in the world, to co-faciliate a psychoeducation and process group for formerly incarcerated parents with histories of gang-involvement. Being honoring with the opportunity to work with these families fills my heart with indescribable joy each week.
